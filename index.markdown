Welcome to the Castle And Critters page.

I made Castles And Critters to address a number of problems that I encountered while playing D&D over the years.

1. Spellcasters were super OP when they had spells and super boring when they ran out.

2. Melee fighters were in general fairly boring to play as they didn't have many fun abilities.

3. The game was very complicated. This was the main issue. I can't tell you how many times I had to explain the difference between Intelligence and Wisdom. Creating new characters could take a very long time, even if the skill system was mostly skipped over.

4. There was a point in the game where the characters became so powerful that weaker monsters seemed pointless.
