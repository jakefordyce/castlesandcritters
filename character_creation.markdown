There are no classes in this system. There are also only 4 skills to write down and no attributes to roll. This means character creation is very fast.

Each player starts with 10 Health and 10 Energy. Each Skill starts at a 0 unless the player has an ability or item that increases it.

They then choose their abilities. At level 1, each player gets to choose 5 abilities.

They then choose their equipment and use that to determine their Offensive and Defensive stats.

# Explanation Of Each Stat

Health - When this reaches 0, your character is unconscious and cannot move or take actions. Each round they will recover 1 Health until they are back at 1, in which case they can take a Standard Action to stand. If Health reaches a negative amount equal to the amount of total health that they have (a character with 10 health will need to reach -10) then the character is dead.

Energy - This powers the use of some abilities and recovers at a rate of 1 per hour.

Iniative - This is added to the D20 roll at the beginning of each combat to determine the order of turns.

Move - This is how many squares a character can move if they use a Standard Action to move.

Attack - The power of your physical attacks, I.E. your ability to swing a sword and damage something.

Magic - The power of your spells.

Healing - Your ability to heal a target.

Armor - Your physical resistance to damage.

Resist - Your resistance to magical damage.

Strength - Your ability to do things that require being strong, like kicking down doors or climbing a rope.

Finesse - Your ability to do things that require finesse, like picking a lock or sneaking around.

Knowledge - This is how likely it is that your character knows something that isn't common knowledge.

Perception - This is how likely it is that your character sees or notices something, like a distant enemy or a change in the pattern on the wall.
