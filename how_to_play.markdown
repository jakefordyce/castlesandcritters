# Turn Order

The order of turns goes by Initiative. At the start of combat, each combatant rolls a D20 and adds their initiative score. The highest initiative goes first, followed by the next and so on.

If two or more players got the same Initiative, then the one with the higher bonus goes first.

If they have equal bonuses, they roll again to see who goes first among the ones that tied.

# Actions

In each character's turn, they can take 2 standard actions.

Moving 5 squares (unless an ability says you can move further) takes 1 action.

When using an Ability, you can move 1 square.

Once per turn a player may take an Interrupt Action. This happens only when triggered by someone else's action and happens immediately before they finish their action.

Free Actions may be used any number of times and do not count toward the Standard Action or the Interrupt Action.

# Using Abilities

### Luck Roll

When an Ability is used against a hostile target, a Luck Roll must first be rolled. That is a D20 and has no bonus unless something says you have a bonus to it.

Abilities used against friendly targets automatically count as a Normal Hit.

1-5 Miss.

6-19 Normal Hit

20 Critical Hit (damage only).

There are abilities that affect the miss and crit range.

On a Critical Hit, the dice are rolled twice and bonuses are added twice. If something says the Crit Damage is 3, then the dice are rolled 3 times and the bonuses are added 3 times.

### Damage Roll

The dice rolled during a Damage Roll varies with different weapons and abilities.

For physical attacks, the dice is rolled against the target's Armor. If the difference is positive, then that much damage is dealt.

For magical attacks, the dice is rolled against the target's Resist.

For status effects, the dice are rolled against the Armor or Resist and if the difference is at least 1, then the target is affected.

For Healing, the dice are rolled and not subtracted by any defense.

Healing, Buffs/DeBuffs, and Status Effects cannot be critical.
