# Turn Order

The order of turns goes by Initiative. At the start of combat, each combatant rolls a D20 and adds their initiative score. The highest initiative goes first, followed by the next and so on.

If two or more players got the same Initiative, then the one with the higher bonus goes first.

If they have equal bonuses, they roll again to see who goes first among the ones that tied.

# Actions

In each character's turn, they can take 2 standard actions.

Moving 5 squares (unless an ability says you can move further) takes 1 action.

When using an Ability, you can move 1 square.

Once per turn a player may take an Interrupt Action. This happens only when triggered by someone else's action and happens immediately before they finish their action.

Free Actions may be used any number of times and do not count toward the Standard Action or the Interrupt Action.

# Using Abilities

### Luck Roll

When an Ability is used against a hostile target, a Luck Roll must first be rolled. That is a D20 and has no bonus unless something says you have a bonus to it.

Abilities used against friendly targets automatically count as a Normal Hit.

1-5 Miss.

6-19 Normal Hit

20 Critical Hit (damage only).

There are abilities that affect the miss and crit range.

On a Critical Hit, the dice are rolled twice and bonuses are added twice. If something says the Crit Damage is 3, then the dice are rolled 3 times and the bonuses are added 3 times.

### Damage Roll

The dice rolled during a Damage Roll varies with different weapons and abilities.

For physical attacks, the dice is rolled against the target's Armor. If the difference is positive, then that much damage is dealt.

For magical attacks, the dice is rolled against the target's Resist.

For status effects, the dice are rolled against the Armor or Resist and if the difference is at least 1, then the target is affected.

For Healing, the dice are rolled and not subtracted by any defense.

Healing, Buffs/DeBuffs, and Status Effects cannot be critical.


### Status Effects

Stun/Sleep/Blind etc. are collectively called Status Effects. They affect your character in different ways, limiting what they can do in each case. Each Status Effect will have a duration, after which they will expire on their own. Your character may attempt to recover earlier than that by using their Recover ability.

When a character is affected by a Status Effect, keep track of the power of the effect in case they want to remove it with Recover or a different ability.

A Status effect does not stack with itself. The higher power is used instead. If a character is stunned for 3 power and then another stun affects them with a power of 5, they have a single stun with a power of 5 to dispel, not 8.

Different Status Effects may affect the player at the same time. A character can be stunned and slowed. They would need to recover from each effect separately and can specify which one they are attempting to recover from (unless an ability says it is random).

Stun/Blind - Your character cannot take actions and cannot move.

Sleep - Your character cannot take actions and cannot move, but taking any damage will make the status effect go away.

Slow - Your character moves at 1/2 speed, but can otherwise use their actions as normal.

Silence - Your character cannot cast spells, but can move and use melee attacks.

Disarm - Your character cannot use melee attacks, but can move and cast spells.
